# <p align="center">LE0: Environment Setup, Debugging, and C++ Refresh<p>

**Introduction**

The objective of this programming assignment is to help you get ready for the mainstream programming assignments (PA1-4) by covering some introductory refresher topics. Through this assignment, you will complete setting up your own development environment where you will work until the end of the semester, learn the use of debuggers to debug your programs, and recap the core concepts of C/C++ programming.

**Tasks**

You are given a simple program, buggy.cpp, that computes the area of shapes that has several compile/syntax errors and several bugs that you are going to discover, debug, and fix with the help of three different debugging methods. Once you have corrected the program and committed to the repository, we will use the auto-grading feature of GitHub Classroom to grade your project.

See LE0 module on canvas for further details and assistance.
